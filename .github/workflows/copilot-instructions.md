Use ultra-modern JavaScript patterns: elegance, conciseness, modularity, efficiency, and readability are prioritized over compatibility with older environments. 

Follow the Rule of Least Power: choose the simplest, most declarative solution that solves the problem. Prefer data structures over functions, templates over imperative code, and web standards over custom APIs.

Use conventional commit message format.
